# AWS-RDS-MySQL
Create and Connect to a Cloud Database Instances
I created a MySQL database instance on AWS RDS using the free tier.
After configuring public access and security rules, I connected using MySQL Workbench.
I created a database and a table named “students,” inserted sample records, and retrieved them successfully.
Through this, I learned how to create, connect, and manage cloud-hosted databases using AWS RDS.
